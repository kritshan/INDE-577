# INDE 577 - Data Science & Machine Learning

Hey! This repo contains implementations of numerous machine learning models and techniques learning during INDE 577, a graduate level Data Science class at Rice University taught by Dr. Randy Davila. I cover both supervised learning and unsupervised learning techniques. Within each folder, I cover multiple types of models by providing a Jupyter Notebook implementation and a descriptive README file. 

I will primarely work with three datasets. 

Supervised Learning:
    - Perceptron
    - Gradient Descent
    - Linear Regression
    - Logistic Regression
    - K-Nearest Neighbors
    - Decision Trees
    - Ensemble Methods

Unsupervised Learning:
    - DBScan
    - K-Means
    - PCA
