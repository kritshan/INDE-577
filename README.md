# INDE 577 - Data Science & Machine Learning

Hey! This repo contains implementations of numerous machine learning models and techniques learning during INDE 577, a graduate level Data Science class at Rice University taught by Dr. Randy Davila. I cover both supervised learning and unsupervised learning techniques. Within each folder, I cover multiple types of models by providing a Jupyter Notebook implementation and a descriptive README file. 

For both regression and classification tasks, I will primarely work with the Auto-MPG dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. I chose this dataset because I am a huge fan of anything cars-related. I am interested in seeing how a vehicle's efficiency is affected by its different characteristics, like its horsepower or weight. It could provide insight into how possible engine or vehicle modifications affect effiency, as well. 

The dataset can be viewed at this link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/9/auto+mpg

Here is a brief overview of what will be covered in both supervised and unsupervised learning. 

#### Supervised Learning:
* Perceptron
* Gradient Descent
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Decision Trees
* Ensemble Methods

#### Unsupervised Learning:
* DBScan
* K-Means
* PCA
