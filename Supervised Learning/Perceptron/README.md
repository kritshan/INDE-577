## Perceptron

The perceptron is one of the simplest types of artificial neural networks, serving as a fundamental building block in machine learning. Conceptually, it mimics the way a biological neuron works in the human brain. It takes multiple input signals, processes them, and produces a single binary output.

While perceptrons are simple and intuitive, they have limitations. For instance, they can only classify linearly separable data. However, by combining multiple perceptrons in layers, more complex models like multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) can be constructed, enabling the handling of nonlinear data. Despite their simplicity, perceptrons and their derivatives remain essential tools in the field of machine learning.
