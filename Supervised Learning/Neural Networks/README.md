# Neural Networks

Neural networks are a class of machine learning algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes, or neurons, arranged in layers. Information flows through these networks, starting from the input layer, passing through hidden layers, and producing an output. Each connection between neurons has associated weights that adjust during training, allowing the network to learn patterns and relationships in the data. Neural networks are powerful tools for tasks such as classification, regression, pattern recognition, and more, and they've found applications in various fields like image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and robotics.
