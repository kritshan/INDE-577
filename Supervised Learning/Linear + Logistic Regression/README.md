# Linear + Logistic Regression Models


### Linear Regression:

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between one or more independent variables and a continuous dependent variable. It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line, often referred to as the regression line, that minimizes the difference between the observed and predicted values of the dependent variable.


### Logistic Regression
Logistic regression, on the other hand, is a statistical method used for binary classification problems, where the dependent variable is categorical with two possible outcomes. Unlike linear regression, which predicts continuous values, logistic regression models the probability that an instance belongs to a particular category. It uses the logistic function to transform the output of a linear combination of independent variables into a probability score, which is then mapped to one of the two categories based on a chosen threshold.
