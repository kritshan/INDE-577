Gradient Descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm in machine learning, crucial for adjusting model parameters to minimize a predefined loss function. By iteratively computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter, it guides updates in the direction of steepest descent, gradually converging towards the optimal solution. Widely applied across different machine learning tasks, from training neural networks to optimizing regression models, Gradient Descent is the foundation of model optimization.

Linear regression is a fundamental statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. It assumes that there is a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.

We can utilize Gradient Descent and Linear Regression together by using the optimization algorithm to minimize the cost function of the regression model.
