The K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple yet effective supervised learning method used for classification and regression tasks. In KNN, the prediction for a new data point is made based on the majority class (for classification) or the average (for regression) of its K nearest neighbors in the feature space.

Here's how it works:

1. Training: Store all the training data points along with their corresponding labels in memory.

2. Prediction: 
* For a new data point, calculate its distance to all other points in the training set. Common distance metrics include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, or cosine similarity.
* Select the K closest data points (neighbors) to the new point based on the calculated distances.
* For classification, assign the class label that appears most frequently among the K neighbors to the new data point.
* For regression, predict the average of the target values of the K neighbors.

3. Choosing K: The choice of K affects the performance of the algorithm. A smaller K may lead to more flexible decision boundaries but may be sensitive to noise, while a larger K may lead to smoother decision boundaries but might miss local patterns. The optimal K value is often determined through cross-validation.

KNN is simple to understand and implement, but it can be computationally expensive, especially with large datasets, as it requires calculating distances to all data points during prediction. Additionally, it may not perform well with high-dimensional data or when the features are not scaled appropriately.
