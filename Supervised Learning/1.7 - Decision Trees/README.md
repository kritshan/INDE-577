Decision trees are a popular tool in machine learning and data analysis for making decisions or predictions. They represent a flowchart-like structure where each internal node represents a "test" on an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label or a decision.

At each node, the algorithm selects the feature that best splits the data into the purest possible subsets (homogeneous with respect to the target variable), typically measured using metrics like entropy. This process continues recursively, creating a tree until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum tree depth or minimum number of samples in a leaf node.

Decision trees are easy to interpret and visualize, making them useful for understanding the underlying decision-making process. They can handle both numerical and categorical data, and they're capable of handling multi-output problems. However, they tend to overfit noisy data, which can be mitigated by techniques like pruning or using ensemble methods like random forests or gradient boosting.
