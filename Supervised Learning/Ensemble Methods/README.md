# Ensemble Methods

Ensemble methods are powerful machine learning techniques that combine the predictions of multiple base models to improve overall performance. The basic idea is that by aggregating the predictions of several models, the ensemble can often achieve better results than any individual model alone.

There are various types of ensemble methods, but we will choose to explore these 3 specific types:
* Hard Voting
* Bagging
* Random Forests

Ensemble methods are widely used across various domains and have been shown to be very effective in improving predictive accuracy and robustness of machine learning models.
