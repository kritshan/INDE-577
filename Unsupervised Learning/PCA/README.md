# Principal Component Analysis

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used in machine learning and statistics. Its primary goal is to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while preserving most of its variance.

PCA works by transforming the original high-dimensional data into a new coordinate system where the axes (principal components) are orthogonal to each other and aligned with the directions of maximum variance in the data. These principal components are ordered by the amount of variance they explain, with the first component capturing the most variance and subsequent components capturing decreasing amounts.

By retaining only the top principal components that explain most of the variance, PCA effectively reduces the dimensionality of the data. This reduction can lead to simpler models, faster computation, and improved generalization performance by reducing the risk of overfitting.
