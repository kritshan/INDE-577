## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a branch of machine learning where the algorithm learns patterns and structures from unlabeled data. Here's an overview of how it works:

* Unlabeled Data: Unlike supervised learning, where the data is labeled with the correct output, in unsupervised learning, the algorithm is given a dataset without any corresponding output labels. This data consists only of input features.

* Discovering Patterns: The goal of unsupervised learning is to discover hidden patterns, structures, or relationships within the data. Without explicit guidance from labeled examples, the algorithm must find inherent structures in the data on its own.

* Evaluation: Unlike supervised learning, evaluating the performance of unsupervised learning algorithms can be more challenging since there are no ground truth labels to compare against. Evaluation typically involves qualitative analysis, visualization, or domain-specific metrics.

* Applications: Unsupervised learning is used in various domains, including customer segmentation, anomaly detection in cybersecurity, image and document clustering, topic modeling in natural language processing, and more.


Unsupervised learning plays a crucial role in exploring and understanding data, identifying patterns, and extracting valuable insights without the need for labeled examples. Common tasks are anomaly detection, dimensionality reduction, and clustering. It can include algorithms like PCA, DBScan, and K-Means Clustering.
